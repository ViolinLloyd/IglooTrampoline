Igloo Trampoline is a Unity game I created in a week as part of the "Game A Week" Challenge. You can read about my process here: https://violinlloyd.wixsite.com/portfolio/post/igloo-trampoline-agaw-3-postmortem

I ended up revisiting the game after that postmortem to add in a few of the changes based on player feedback. This included adding a visual indicator for the trajectory of the ice block and changing the target zone to being a square.
